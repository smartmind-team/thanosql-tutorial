    "ðŸ‘‰ Classification is a form of machine learning used to predict the category(or class) to which the target belongs. For example, both binary classifications that classify men or women and multiple classifications that predict animal species (dogs, cats, rabbits, etc.) are included in the classification task.\n",

    "ðŸ‘‰ Build a model that classifies more than 10,000 products using the `Product Image` dataset from [AI-Hub](https://aihub.or.kr/)), a leading AI open data sharing platform. The built model can be used as a detection and identification solution in smart logistics warehouses and unmanned stores. Datasets typically consist of over 10,000 commodity datasets of images and label (correct) pairs used to learn image classification techniques, and contain a total of 1,440,000 images. In this tutorial, you will only use 1,800 sheets of training data and 200 sheets of test data to learn how to use ThanoSQL and to check results quickly.\n",

    "> - The image classification model can be used to predict one target value (Target, Category/Label) from one image.\n",
    "> - There must be a column representing the path of the image and a column representing the target value of the image.\n",
    "> - The base model of the corresponding image classification model ( `CONVNEXT `) uses a GPU.Depending on the size and batch size of the model used, GPU memory may be low. In this case, try using a smaller model or reducing the batch size."
