    "--- \n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Classification is a form of machine learning used to predict the category (or class) to which the target belongs. For example, both binary classifications that classify men or women and multiple classifications that predict animal species (dogs, cats, rabbits, etc.) are included in the classification task.\n",

    "**NLP (Natural Language Processing)** \n",
    "--- \n",
    "NLP can be classified as natural language understanding and natural language generation depending on the purpose of the operation. Understanding natural language refers to the process of converting a natural language that a person understands into a value that a computer can understand. On the other hand, natural language generation further refers to the process of converting computer-readable values into natural language so that people can understand them.\n",

    "ðŸ‘‰ Create a model that categorizes the emotions of movie reviews using Kaggle's IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, a representative machine learning competition platform. This dataset consists of 50,000 movie review text and a target for positive or negative emotions. Based on the movie rating, a value less than 5 is expressed as negative and a value greater than 7 is expressed as positive, and each individual film does not have more than 30 review results.\n",
