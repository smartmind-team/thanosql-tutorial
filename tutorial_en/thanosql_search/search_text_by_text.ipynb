    "    <p>Computers cannot directly interpret human language(natural language). Therefore, a process for converting natural language into numerical data that can be recognized by computers is required. In the field of natural language processing, embedding refers to the result of converting human natural language into a vectorized format, which is a form that can be understood by machines.</p>\n",
