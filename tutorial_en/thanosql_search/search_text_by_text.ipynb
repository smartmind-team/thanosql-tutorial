    "    <p>Computers cannot directly interpret human language (natural language). Therefore, a process for converting natural language into numerical data that can be recognized by computers is required. In the field of natural language processing, embedding refers to the result of converting human natural language into a vectorized format, which is a form that can be understood by machines.</p>\n",

    "Techniques for converting natural language into embeddings are largely divided into statistical techniques and artificial neural network-based techniques. ThanoSQL provides a method to train a text vectorization model using self-supervised learning.\n",

However, because we are demonstrating self-supervised learning, this tutorial does not use label values. By training a model with 4,000 movie reviews, we will be able to search text by text and extract the importance of each word from a given movie review.Â </p>\n",

As this is a beginner-level tutorial, we focused on the process rather than accuracy. The model's accuracy can be improved by adjusting various options, such as increasing the epoch or dataset size. Create your own model and provide competitive services by combining various unstructured data (image, audio, video, etc.) and structured data with ThanoSQL.\n",
