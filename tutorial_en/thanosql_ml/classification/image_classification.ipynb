    "    <h4 class=\"admonition-title\">Understanding Classification</h4>\n",
    "    <p>Classification is a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\">Machine Learning</a> used to predict categories (Category or Class) to which the target belongs to. For example, both binary classifications (used for classifying men or women) and multiple classifications (used to predict animal species such as dogs, cats, rabbits, etc.) are included in the classification tasks. <br></p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The image classification contest ([ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet)) has been held since 2010. The winning model at the beginning of the competition showed a 72% accuracy. In 2015, the [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model that won showed 96% accuracy and started to surpass human classification capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"admonition tip\">\n",
    "   <p>The human ability to classify the same data is estimated at about 95%.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though [Data labeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeled_data) is important for accurate image classification, methods of correcting the dataset using the weights of the pre-trained model are widely used. This method allows deep learning models training even with a relatively small number of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ThanoSQL provides a variety of pre-trained models and allows model creation using simple queries. With this, users can derive insights from images with difficult to quantify features with properly trained models and utilize them for various services.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The following are examples and applications of the ThanoSQL classification model.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ThanoSQL image classification model reduces the process of finding suitable categories for product registration in online sales services. You can categorize product photos with a simple query. Users can save time compared to traditional image classification by focusing just on correcting some misclassified data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When renting or selling art works, you can roughly classify works that are difficult to classify because of their vague criteria such as the feeling, technique, and suitable location of each work using the image classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can detect and classify defective products with scratches and damage that were visually checked in manufacturing plants. Signal information such as laser spectrum can also be applied to the image classification model by being processed with techniques such as visualization transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"admonition tip\">\n",
    "   <p>You can also use the behavioral trend of people who like art to create a classification model that finds groups of people who are most likely to enjoy a particular piece of art. In other words, using only artwork images, you can create a model that predicts preferences based on age, gender, place, and etc.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"admonition note\">\n",
    "   <h4 class=\"admonition-title\">In this tutorial</h4>\n",
    "   <p>ðŸ‘‰ Build an image classification model to classify more than 10,000 products using the <code>Product Image</code> dataset from <a href=\"https://aihub.or.kr/\">AI-Hub</a>, a data sharing platform. The model can be used for detection and identification in smart warehouses and unmanned stores.\n",
    "   The model can be used as a detection solution in smart logistics warehouses and unmanned stores. Datasets typically consist of over 10,000 products with images and label (correct) pairs used to for image classification techniques, and contain a total of 1,440,000 images. In this tutorial, you will use 1,800 training data points and 200 test data points to learn how to use ThanoSQL and to obtain results quickly. <br></p>\n",

It is also possible to train the base model using your own data, or to vectorize and transform your data using a self-supervised model, and then distributing it using automated machine learning (Auto-ML) technique.
