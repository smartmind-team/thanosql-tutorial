    "    <p> Time series data is a collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time. The well-known time series data, for example, are gross domestic product (GDP), price index, sales volume, composite stock index (Nasdaq or KOSPI), precipitation, sunspots, and experimental and observational data. Time series data can be divided into continuous time series that are measured continuously and discrete time series that are measured at a discrete point in time. Here, \"continuous time series\" literally means data measured at every point in time. As it is, continuous time series data is difficult to analyze because it has a high chance of containing a large amount of noise, the data might be non-stationary, and it might have been influenced by a variety of external factors like economic indicators or seasonal effects. Therefore, discrete time series data is more often used in the real world. Discrete time series data refers to observations measured at a particular point in time and usually keeps the interval between observations constant.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series analysis is a method that predicts the future by understanding the characteristics of data displayed at regular time intervals (trend fluctuations, seasonal fluctuations, cyclical fluctuations, and irregular fluctuations). By using time series analysis, you can predict next year's sales volume and next month's potential passengers. The disadvantage of time series analysis is that when trying to predict using a time series model created by researchers, several accidental events can occur and result in errors. The time series prediction model is just a mathematical model and prone to errors because it does not take into account the various variables that are present in nature, politics, economics, society, and culture.\n",

    "__The following are examples and applications of the ThanoSQL Time Series Forecasting model.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can predict next month's sales for your business in advance. This will help you set up better strategies for your business based on the expected future production volume.\n",
    "- You can predict power usage in advance. The model learns the seasonal characteristics of power usage to predict next month's power usage in advance. This will help you adjust power production based on the predicted values to prevent blackouts.\n",
