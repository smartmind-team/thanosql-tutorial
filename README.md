## Introduction

The ThanoSQL Tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to the various algorithms used in ThanoSQL for analyzing and processing data. ThanoSQL is an integrated platform that enables AI modeling and searching of both structured and unstructured data using SQL queries, allowing you to query data from various sources including databases and other query engines. This tutorial explains how to improve the performance of SQL queries using the algorithms in ThanoSQL.

Some of the models covered in the tutorials include SBERT, Whisper, and CLIP. The tutorial also provides detailed guidance on using ThanoSQL for specific tasks such as creating databases and tables, importing data, running queries, and creating custom functions. Each tutorial contains clear and concise instructions with examples to help users effectively learn how to use ThanoSQL.

Additionally, the tutorials are structured as `.ipynb` files, allowing users to run code cells interactively and view the results within the same document. `.ipynb` files are a file format used in Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share interactive documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

Overall, the ThanoSQL Tutorial is an excellent resource for anyone looking to improve the performance of their SQL queries by leveraging ThanoSQL's algorithm libraries. Moreover, by enabling copy-and-paste functionality for the code snippets, the tutorials provide clear and concise examples of ThanoSQL, making them suitable for beginners seeking to explore ThanoSQL.
